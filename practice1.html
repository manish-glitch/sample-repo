        <h1>hello myself Manish Shingare</h1>
        <p>this is first time I am trying to build a very basic<strong>website containing a <em>title</em> and in body a simple paragraph</strong> </p>
        <p>so this means I can put bold and italic text in between paragraph very easily</p>
        <p>Today I even learned to apply different theames, apply different extensions on vs code</p>
        <ul>
            <h1>perks of using vs code</h1>
            <li>a hell lot of extensions</li>
            <li>you did not have to install multiple editors for different languages</li>
            <p>the only thins you need to do is....download different extensions</p>
        </ul>
